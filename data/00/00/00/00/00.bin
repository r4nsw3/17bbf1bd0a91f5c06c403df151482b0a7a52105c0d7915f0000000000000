  |   Doodland is a grotesque world created on a piece of paper.            |
  |   It is invaded by Omnomus, a cruel monster that loves the taste of     |
  |   inhabitants of this land. Each part of the world has a unique         |
  |   atmosphere. You will have to run, jump, swim and fly to overcome      |
  |   many demanding obstacles.                                             |

  |   Doodlers are peaceful and brave creatures living in Doodland,         |
  |   choose which one you will help to escape. There are no two same       |
  |   Doodlers. Each of them looks different and sounds different, but      |
  |   every one of them has one common feature - digestive problems.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   BOOSTERS:                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Omnomus has no mercy. If you are on reach, he will eat you without    |
  |   blinking an eye. Fortunately Doodlers can use their gastric           |
  |   problems against him:                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Just find a match, light your fart and feel the boost.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   And if this won't help, just release stinky gases in his face to      |
  |   stun him. This is your last resort.                                   |
